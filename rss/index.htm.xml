Although it can cost a little more, Courier shipments are always assigned a tracking number so you can track your order on its journey to you. Most countries&#x2019; DHL Express providers will also contact you in the event there are customs delays or delivery problems. Airmail shipments are transferred from the United States Postal Service to your local postal service or delivery carrier. The level of service this method of shipping provides is very basic and does not include transit alerts or delivery progress of your package. This means that if your package gets lost in transit or stuck in customs, notifications of these events are seldom and at the total discretion of your postal service. Courier is the recommended shipping method for orders higher in quantity and cost. Please be aware that some countries may not allow airmail shipments of large-sized items, so Courier is also recommended when ordering banners, banner stands, and meeting signs.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How will Pathways be affected by GDPR?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Toys fully loyalty.

Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don&apos;t trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors &amp; Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>Ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.</em></blockquote><hr><p>If you&apos;re looking for insights, tips and reference materials to expand your content business, here&apos;s 5 top resources to get you started:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/how-to-create-a-newsletter/"><strong>How to create a premium newsletter (+ some case studies)</strong></a><strong> </strong> <br>Learn how others run successful paid email newsletter products</li><li><strong><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/membership-sites/">The ultimate guide to membership websites for creators</a></strong><br>Tips to help you build, launch and grow your new membership business</li><li><strong><a href="https://newsletterguide.org/">The Newsletter Guide</a></strong><br>A 201 guide for taking your newsletters to the next level</li><li><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/find-your-niche-creator-economy/"><strong>The proven way to find your niche, explained</strong></a><br>Find the overlap and find a monetizable niche that gets noticed</li><li><strong><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/newsletter-referral-programs/">Should you launch a referral program? </a></strong><br>Strategies for building a sustainable referral growth machine</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Which Is Healthier, Pizza Or Burger?

Everything about your layout and design can be changed, so you&apos;re not stuck with yet another clone of a social network profile.</p><p>How far you want to go with customization is completely up to you, there&apos;s no right or wrong approach! The majority of people use one of Ghost&apos;s built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows. </p><p>The best way to get started is with Ghost&apos;s branding settings, where you can set up colors, images and logos to fit with your brand.</p><p>Any Ghost theme that&apos;s up to date and compatible with Ghost 4.0 and higher will reflect your branding settings in the preview window, so you can see what your site will look like as you experiment with different options.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xi1CKzeA01c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Pizza Hut</figcaption></figure><p>When selecting an accent color, try to choose something which will contrast well with white text. Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements. Vibrant colors with a darker hue tend to work best, as a general rule.</p><p>However, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can pick out a look and feel that suits you best.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://backoffice.gthememarket.com/content/images/2021/07/blog-img14.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Which Is Healthier, Pizza Or Burger?

Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.</p><ul><li><strong>Casper</strong> <em>(default)</em> &#x2014; Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters</li><li><strong>Edition</strong> &#x2014; A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors</li><li><strong>Alto</strong> &#x2014; A slick news/magazine style design for creators</li><li><strong>London</strong> &#x2014; A light photography theme with a bold grid</li><li><strong>Ease</strong> &#x2014; A library theme for organizing large content archives</li></ul><p>And if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/">Ghost Marketplace</a>, where you&apos;ll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.</p><h2 id="building-something-custom">Building something custom</h2><p>Finally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.</p><p>Ghost&apos;s theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.</p><p>If you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it&apos;s like, you can <a href="https://github.com/tryghost/casper/">browse through the files of the default Casper theme</a>. We&apos;ve added tons of inline code comments to make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.</p><p>See? Not that scary! But still completely optional. </p><p>If you&apos;re interested in creating your own Ghost theme, check out our extensive <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/themes/">theme documentation</a> for a full guide to all the different template variables and helpers which are available.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
